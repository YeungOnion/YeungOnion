- 👋 Hi, I’m @YeungOnion, my name is Orion Yeung, I use he/him pronouns
- 👀 I’m interested in physics and high performance computing to support scientific advances. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the ropes for DevOps in performance distributed computing as well as a few languages that are fun and may be useful for developing tooling that supports researcher use cases
  - go, for [bubble tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)
  - rust, for general purpose
  - elixir, for application development
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on tools that disrupt ROOT as a monolithic software in high energy physics analysis
  - I'm of the mindset that alternativevs provide more opportunities to explore.
